I. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------
Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - BSA Radar (Authenticated) 

II. BACKGROUND
-------------------------
BSA Radar is a banking application provided by GLOBAL Radar which is implemented within corporate environments to perform SWIFT transactions, approve and review transactions, manage documents, manage users and roles and other features.

III. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------
The "Firstname" and "Lastname" parameters in Global RADAR BSA Radar 1.6.7234.X are vulnerable to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via the Update User Profile feature (in the top-right of the application).

IV. History
-------------------------
The vulnerability was originally disclosed to the vendor on November 4, 2019.  
The CVE was originally submitted on June 19, 2020.  
CVE assigned: CVE-2020-14943

V. PROOF OF CONCEPT
-------------------------
Using the "update user profile" feature in the top-right of the application while logged in, a malicious user can inject malicious, unencoded scripts, such as "**<script>alert(1)</script>**", into the Firstname and Lastname parameters of a user account. This stored XSS will execute on nearly every application page as these parameters are always present while logged in. This attack can be further leveraged by utilizing an existing authorization bypass exploit (CVE-2020-14944) to inject stored XSS payloads into these parameters for arbitrary existing user accounts.

VI. BUSINESS IMPACT
-------------------------
Session hijacking, account takeover, disclosure of internal application data, credential theft via phishing.

VII. SYSTEMS AFFECTED
-------------------------
BSA Radar - Version 1.6.7234.24750 and lower

VIII. SOLUTION
-------------------------
Implement input validation and output encoding within the Firstname and Lastname input parameters to prevent malicious code and scripts from being injected into the application and stored. Sanitize HTML meta-characters such as "<" and ">" and other Javascript-related characters.
